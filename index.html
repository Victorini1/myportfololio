      <p>
            I have always been the go-to person in my family to fix computer hardware issues and solve mysteries
             of "why the internet went out". I decided that it was time I get paid to render services to those in 
             need for professional help. In school I learned more about the possibilities of automation and how it 
             could begin to make life so much easier for those in need. From peoples with disabilities, to those 
             trying to discover new means to accomplish everyday goals, technology and automation is constantly 
             evolving and wanting for more creative minds to solve mysteries. Through working in the corporate world 
             in my short time so far, it is clear that there is a need to keep evolving. I started learning more on my
              own the intricacies of demystifying technology to those in need of it. I dived headlong into technology and
               never looked back and hope to continue to grow my skills to help those in need.
